pip install -r requirements/local.txt
```

## Usage

Unlock the full potential of FlexiTrace with these exciting features:

- **Cycle Detection on Rotation Matrix**: Dive into the core of movement patterns based on rotation matrices. Uncover the graceful flow of motion cycles.
- **Repetitions Cycle Duration**: Analyze the duration of repetitions with precision. Analyze the exact duration of repetitions to fine-tune your performance and progress.
- **Repetitions Count**: Keep track of every repetition effortlessly. Whether it's for fitness, sports, or research, count them all and gain valuable insights.

FlexiTrace empowers you to transform raw data into actionable insights, making your analysis both engaging and informative.

## Dataset Parameters

Now we are analyzing movement patterns using the FlexiTrace app's dataset for motion analysis.

The ALLJoints.csv file provided for each dataset sample includes the parameters that were used to generate that specific sample. For convenience, we provide a description of each parameter below:

- **Frame_Order**: Represents the order or timestamp of the frame within the dataset.
- **Anchor_Name**: Denotes the name or identifier of the anchor used in the sample.
- **Anchor_Anatomy_Name**: Describes the anatomy or characteristics of the anchor used.
- **Created_At**: Indicates the timestamp when the sample was created or recorded.
- **Local_Position_x/y/z**: Represents the local position coordinates (**x**, **y**, and **z**) of an object in the sample's local space.
- **World_Position_x/y/z**: Indicates the world position coordinates (**x**, **y**, and **z**) of an object in the sample's global space.

## Results

### Visualizing 3D Joint Rotation Matrices for Hips Joint

I captured squat exercise using the FlexiTrace app and began evaluating the results. Below is a visualization of the 3x3 rotation matrix indexes for the hips joint:

</div>

### Detecting Repetition Cycles

To identify repetition cycles, we used a difference calculation and detected peaks in the data. The GIF below illustrates the detected repetition cycle for the hips joint:

</div>

### Applying the Method to All Transformation Matrix Indexes

we extended this method to all indexes of the transformation matrix and plotted the repetition cycle and cycle duration in my dataset. The GIF below shows the 3x3 results of the repetition count for all transformation matrix indexes:

By using this approach, we could accurately count the repetitions of the squat exercise.
